Translated source code to english and made it readable, removed devzones dependency (just removes the hassle of having to create zones for every single map), updated code to the new 1.8 Syntax (why would a plugin that was made private in 2018 still use 1.7 syntax anyway), removed commented code (no idea why he left those).

Be noted that all functon that have comments on their bodies were copied from other plugins. That's pretty obvious since 1: those comments are actually in english and 2: franug doesn't comment anything either way
