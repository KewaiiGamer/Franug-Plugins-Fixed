Franug description: DeathMatch arena for dead people: A deathmatch arena for dead people for wait when you are dead. Included support for myjailbreak plugin, spawn protection, hud message when join people to the dm arena, multilanguage support, and full support.

Kewaii Description: Plugin is completely broken. There is no support for the myjailbreak plugin, there is however support for jailbreak maps (IDK if it is even needed as it just disables the plugin for two maps). Multilanguage support is a lie since every single chat message is in Spanish english (english spoken by spaniards?) and translations are not even implemented. No spawn protection (or maybe there is. I didn't really care to test it and everything is in spanish anyways). 


I downloaded this plugin a few months ago from https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=276663
It was unapproved because the plugin went private (for the second time). I guess I got the most recent version while it was public. 

https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2376276#post2376276 I don't really understand why someone who says "the money dont care" (england is my city) would make a public plugin and then make it private and only update it afterwards. Maybe he actually cares a lot about money.
